# Happy Rakhi Video 

**Project Type:** Social Media Video  
**Tool Used:** Canva  
**Duration:** 5 seconds  
**Project Date:** June 2025

## About the Project
This is a short and sweet video I designed for **Raksha Bandhan** using Canva.  
It was made to share on social media like Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.

The video includes festive colors, animated text, and traditional Rakhi decorations to celebrate the bond between siblings.

## Goal
To create a quick, eye-catching Rakhi greeting that can be used by brands like **Giftmandu** for promotion.
