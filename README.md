#  My Canva Greeting Card Projects

Hi!  I'm a student learning design and front-end development.  
These are some of my creative projects made using **Canva** â€” greeting cards for different occasions!

I created them to practice layout, color, and visual storytelling.  
Iâ€™m also using them to build my portfolio for internships like the one at **Giftmandu**
