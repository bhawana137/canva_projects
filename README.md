#  My Canva Greeting Card Projects

Hi!  I'm a student learning design and front-end development.  
These are some of my creative greeting card projects made using **Canva**!

I created these to explore layouts, color matching, and design thinking — and I'm sharing them here as part of my design portfolio and internship application for **Giftmandu**.
